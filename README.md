## üöÄ Features

### 1. AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System
- **Input Parameters**: Farmers enter environmental data (N, P, K levels, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall) to receive **AI-driven crop recommendations** (e.g., rice varieties suited to the conditions).  
- **Cultivation Guidance**: Detailed resources on planting techniques, watering schedules, fertilizer usage, and harvesting methods for the recommended crop.

### 2. Crop Disease Analyzer with Chatbot
- **Image Upload**: Farmers upload images of infected crops to identify diseases (e.g., bacterial blight, fungal infections).  
- **Instant Solutions**: Receive actionable remedies, including recommended insecticides, organic treatments, and preventive measures.  
- **AI Chatbot**: Ask follow-up questions about the diagnosis or solutions via an integrated chatbot.

### 3. Agricultural Marketplace
- **Direct Trade**: Farmers list their produce for sale, and buyers/sellers connect directly, eliminating middlemen.  
- **Price Transparency**: Real-time market prices and trends to help farmers make informed selling decisions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
1. **Crop Recommendation**  
   - Navigate to the **Crop Prediction** tab.  
   - Enter soil/environmental parameters (N, P, K, temperature, etc.).  
   - Click **Generate Prediction** to view the optimal crop and cultivation guide.  

2. **Disease Detection**  
   - Go to **Disease Analyzer**, upload an image of the affected crop.  
   - Review the diagnosis and treatment suggestions.  
   - Use the **Chatbot** to ask follow-up questions (e.g., "How to apply neem oil?").  

3. **Marketplace**  
   - Create a profile as a Farmer/Buyer.  
   - List crops for sale or browse available produce.
